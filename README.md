# 5x3 Display and Sequence Generator
[The project can be simulated here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/kFDdGqKnbat-5x3-display-and-sequence-generator?sharecode=WqqfOPZSOn_uz6iXAdQBumaqDsZAPenCJGjMhOgIZEY)

`optimize.py` is the script used find the best possible combination of boolean expressions (lowest gate input cost) for each J and K input in the sequence generator part of the project by using a greedy algorithm. The corresponding truth table to an excel file.
